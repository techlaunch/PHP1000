# PHP1000_template_exercise
Template exercise for the PHP class

## Directions
You are working on a project building a website for a famous chef from the TV. The front-end developer just finished the template and send you the HTML file with all the styles and JS scripts. Your job is to plug the information that will come from the database. The data engineers just gave you a “data” file with all the variables and arrays that must be shown dynamically to the user.

Both files were uploaded to this GitHub repo. Using the data file, plug dynamically the title in both the <title> tag and the page header. Also, the list of food posts and the tags on the footer. 
  
## Bonus
If this task gets to easy for you, search for a famous chef online and replace all the placeholder texts and images by real information about the persona, making the page ready for a production environment.
